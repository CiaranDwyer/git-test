The test begins when the Cucumber runner class is executed.

Cucumber reads the feature file and identifies the scenarios and steps to run.

Before each scenario:

The @Before hook runs → sets up the browser using Selenium.

During each scenario:

Cucumber matches each step in the feature file with step definitions.

Your Page Object classes are used to interact with the browser.

After each scenario:

The @After hook runs → quits and cleans up the browser.
