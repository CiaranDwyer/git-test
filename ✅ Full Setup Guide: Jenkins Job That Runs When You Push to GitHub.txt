✅ Full Setup Guide: Jenkins Job That Runs When You Push to GitHub

This guide helps you set up Jenkins to automatically run a job when code is pushed to GitHub. No complex terms — just clear steps anyone can follow.

🚀 What You’ll Need:

Jenkins installed and running locally (http://localhost:8080)

A GitHub account with a repo (public or private)

Ngrok to expose Jenkins to GitHub

Git installed (optional but helpful)

🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Start Jenkins

Make sure Jenkins is running. Open this in your browser:

http://localhost:8080

2. Start Ngrok to Expose Jenkins

In a terminal window, run:

ngrok http 8080


Leave this terminal open. You’ll see a link like:

https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app


This makes your local Jenkins visible to GitHub.

3. Create a New Jenkins Job

Go to Jenkins dashboard

Click “New Item”

Enter a name like My-GitHub-Job

Choose “Freestyle project”

Click OK

4. Link Jenkins to GitHub

Inside your job config:

Scroll to Source Code Management

Choose Git

In Repository URL, enter your GitHub HTTPS URL
Example:

https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git


If the repo is private:

Click Add > Jenkins

Use your GitHub username and a personal access token
 instead of a password

5. Add a Build Step

Scroll to Build section

Click “Add build step” > “Execute shell”

Example command (Linux/macOS):

echo "Code has been pushed!"
ls


For Windows, use “Execute Windows batch command” instead.

6. Enable GitHub Trigger

Scroll to Build Triggers

Check this box: ✅ “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”

7. Save the Job

Click “Save” at the bottom.

8. Create a Webhook in GitHub

Go to your GitHub repo

Click Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook

Fill it out like this:

Payload URL:

https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/


Content type:

application/json


Secret: leave blank (optional)

Events:
Leave on "Just the push event"

Click “Add Webhook”

9. Test It! 🚨

Go to your GitHub repo

Make a small change (edit a file)

Commit and push it

🔍 Go back to Jenkins — you should see your job running automatically!

🛠 Troubleshooting

Webhook not working?
Go to GitHub → Settings > Webhooks > Click webhook > “Recent Deliveries”
Check if GitHub is showing a green tick or error.

Job not triggering?
Double-check:

Ngrok is still running

Jenkins is running

URL ends in /github-webhook/

Build trigger is enabled in the Jenkins job

Private repo issues?
Use a GitHub personal access token
 with repo permissions when adding Git credentials in Jenkins.
