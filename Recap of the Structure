Recap of the Structure

GoogleSearchPage - Contains methods for interacting with the Google search page.

SearchItem - A simple class to hold the search term (like "apple" or "banana").

SearchAction - Combines the page actions and search term to perform the actual search.

GoogleSearchSteps - Cucumber step definitions that link the feature file steps to the actual code.

How It All Works Together

GoogleSearchSteps defines the actions in plain English based on the feature file steps. It uses the SearchAction to combine the search behavior.

The SearchAction uses the GoogleSearchPage and SearchItem to do the work:

The SearchItem class holds the search term.

The GoogleSearchPage class has methods to type into the search box and click the search button.

SearchAction makes everything happen (enter text, click, and verify results).

This design keeps everything modular and easy to maintain. If you wanted to change how you interact with the Google search page, youâ€™d only need to change the GoogleSearchPage class. The rest of your tests stay the same.
